## Process
I chose to dynamically create the elements on the page. Each piece is created when the submit button is pressed the Data for that particular city pops up with the buildDashboard function and then the forecast elements populate with the data pulled from the arrays in the URLs that are being called from my API key in the buildForecast function.
